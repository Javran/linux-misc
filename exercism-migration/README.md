# Exercism migration scripting

This is the current directory structure for working on Exercism exercises as of writing:

https://github.com/Javran/Thinking-dumps/tree/564336f2082340e93882e563472d5b5ddc75b1a8/exercism

In which `old/` consists of Haskell exercises only and `new/` are some new stuff as I'm learning other languages.

The goal for this scripting is to move all old code into new ones.

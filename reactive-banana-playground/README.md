Just a bunch of packages as I'm trying to get some sense of what FRP is capable of.

Things I want to investigate a bit:

- Support for multithreading:

    + would we run into trouble under a multithreading setting?

- Specifying steps:

    + Say if we want to perform a specific sequence of actions, is it possible to do in FRP?

- Observables?

    + So if we model a global state by event-accumulated behavior,
      can we observe the behavior and trigger events based on a change of behavior?
